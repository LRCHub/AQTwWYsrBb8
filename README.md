```lrc
[00:04.41] I threw a wish in the well
[00:06.26] Don't ask me, I'll never tell
[00:08.38] I looked to you as it fell
[00:10.36] And now you're in my way
[00:12.35] I trade my soul for a wish
[00:14.43] Pennies and dimes for a kiss
[00:16.25] I wasn't looking for this
[00:18.30] But now you're in my way
[00:20.68] Your stare was holdin'
[00:22.14] Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
[00:24.19] Hot night, wind was blowin'
[00:26.23] Where you think you're going, baby?
[00:28.38] Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
[00:32.91] But here's my number, so call me, maybe
[00:36.66] It's hard to look right at you, baby
[00:40.85] But here's my number, so call me, maybe
[00:44.66] Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
[00:48.92] But here's my number, so call me, maybe
[00:52.65] And all the other boys try to chase me
[00:56.93] But here's my number, so call me, maybe
[01:01.25] ♪
[01:04.23] You took your time with the call
[01:06.54] I took no time with the fall
[01:08.40] You gave me nothing at all
[01:10.21] But still, you're in my way
[01:12.21] I beg and borrow and steal
[01:14.52] At first sight, and it's real
[01:16.34] I didn't know I would feel it
[01:18.69] But it's in my way
[01:20.58] Your stare was holdin'
[01:22.20] Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
[01:23.95] Hot night, wind was blowin'
[01:26.10] Where you think you're going, baby?
[01:28.53] Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
[01:32.84] But here's my number, so call me, maybe
[01:36.66] It's hard to look right at you, baby
[01:40.89] But here's my number, so call me, maybe
[01:44.58] Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
[01:48.70] But here's my number, so call me, maybe
[01:52.59] And all the other boys try to chase me
[01:56.86] But here's my number, so call me, maybe
[02:00.34] Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
[02:04.39] I missed you so bad, I missed you so, so bad
[02:08.50] Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
[02:12.14] And you should know that
[02:14.30] I missed you so, so bad
[02:16.96] (Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad)
[02:24.59] It's hard to look right at you, baby
[02:28.87] But here's my number, so call me, maybe
[02:32.69] Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
[02:36.94] But here's my number, so call me, maybe
[02:40.50] And all the other boys try to chase me
[02:44.81] But here's my number, so call me, maybe
[02:48.39] Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
[02:52.31] I missed you so bad, I missed you so, so bad
[02:56.32] Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
[03:00.30] And you should know that
[03:02.73] So call me maybe
